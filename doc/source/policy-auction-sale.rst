.. _POLICY-AUCTION-SALE:

policy-auction-sale
-------------------

Description
^^^^^^^^^^^

This policy manages an auction sale:
  - The seller of the token puts its token on sale and propose a starting price and a multiplier increment.
  - People proposes bids:
     - starting with at least the starting price
     - then by bidding a price that it is at least the last price multiplied by the increment.

Since the `(place-bid)` function is executed out of the defpact context, a second escrow account must be used during
the auctions. The funds from this second escrow account are then transferred to the main Marmalade escrow account before settlement.


This policy work in several steps:

1 - The seller calls the defpact ``sale``. The policy is triggered when ``sale_type`` = "auction".
The policy record the minimum price and the increment.

2 - Buyers call `(place-bid)` and transfers the amount of their bids to the escrow account.

2 - Once the timeout has elapsed, the seller, the buyer or anybody else complete the defpact. The dale amount is transferred to the main escrow account.

In the meantime, some policies with a higher priority (like marketplace or royalty) are allowed
to take a part of the funds from the escrow account.

3 - The ``(enforce-sale-settle)`` hook is called, and the seller is paid with the remaining funds.

The seller is able to withdraw from the sale after the ``timeout`` has elapsed if nobody has placed a bid.

This policy does not support the ``NO-TIMEOUT`` parameter.

Timeout extension
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To keep auctions fair and avoid sniping and malicious activity: the timeout can be extended.

If a bid occurs less than 10 minutes before the end of the sale, the timeout is extended to 30 minutes after the bid time:

Examples:
  - The tiemout was previously set to: ``2023-01-03T06:00:00``, a bid arrives at ``2023-01-03T05:45:00`` => The tiemout is not changed.
  - The tiemout was previously set to: ``2023-01-03T06:00:00``, a bid arrives at ``2023-01-03T05:56:00`` => The tiemout is extended to ``2023-01-03T06:06:00``.

.. _POLICY-AUCTION-SALE-PLACE-BID:

place-bid
~~~~~~~~~
*sale-id* ``string`` *buyer* ``string`` *buyer-guard* ``guard`` *new-price* ``decimal``  *→* ``string``

Place a new bid on the given sale-id.

The bidder should before call ``(get-sale)`` to check the current state of the sale:

- current-price
- escrow account
- increment

The bidder must have installed the TRANSFER capability of the payment currency.

The previous best buyer is automatically refunded.
